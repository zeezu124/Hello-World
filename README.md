My first repo haha

My name is Abdul-Azeez Mahmud-Ajeigbe and I am a software Engineer that graduated from Eastern Mediterranean University.
I am not entirely sure what I wanna do in life or in tech even so this is me just trying things out and figuring out which way I want my life to go.
Here's to great findings.
Sui Generis.
